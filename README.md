# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Prediction-Model
This project uses machine learning to predict employee attrition and identify key factors driving turnover. Using a Random Forest model on IBM data, it pinpoints high-risk talent and drivers like Overtime and Income. This allows HR to move from reactive exit interviews to proactive, data-driven retention strategies.
